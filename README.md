# LangChain Basics 

### 1. Build a Simple LLM Application - SimpleLLM.py

This project provides a basic introduction to building a simple LLM application using LangChain. The application translates text from English to another language through a single LLM call combined with effective prompting. While simple, this serves as an excellent starting point with LangChain, showcasing how much can be achieved with just prompting and an LLM call!

### 2. Build a Simple Chatbot with Memory - Simple_Chatbot.py
