# LangChain Practice - Build a Simple LLM Application

This project provides a basic introduction to building a simple LLM application using LangChain. The application translates text from English to another language through a single LLM call combined with effective prompting. While simple, this serves as an excellent starting point with LangChain, showcasing how much can be achieved with just prompting and an LLM call!

In this project, you will gain a high-level understanding of:

**Using Language Models:** Learn how to integrate and work with language models effectively.

**Prompt Templates:** Discover how to design and utilize prompt templates for dynamic interactions.

**Debugging and Tracing:** Leverage LangSmith to debug, monitor, and optimize your application.
